### Hello

Welcome to Venus-curated Overhead-bloated sharewarestore. All home made, except the piped ones.

Before continuing, you need overhead tools installed.

The only way I can get the package installed is:

(python -m) pip install git+https://github.com/venus-revisioner/overhead.git

Remember to activate your virtual installment firt at venv/Script/activate (or ther variants)

Then the other repos should be working nicely.
